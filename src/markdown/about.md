background: "I started out as a toolmaker and machinist for Holden and because
  of this, I now have 14 years of experience in the manufacturing industry
  managing large teams where I acquired the interpersonal skill set that allows
  me to manage my own business today:\ 



  *'Mikal is one of the warmest and friendliest people I have come across in
  my career as a conveyancer. He is extremely passionate about providing the
  best possible service to his clients and ensuring a positive outcome. You
  cannot help but smile in Mikal's presence. I cannot recommend him highly
  enough for your finance needs.'* \r



  The road to opening my own business started by retraining and working as a
  loan writer and broker through various other companies such as Your Broker and
  LoanPlanners SA. This professional experience in finance, next to my personal
  experience of financing my own passive income, ensures that Mikal Howard
  Finance operates at an exceptional professional standard with a personal
  touch: \r
